Open heroku.com on Chrome or Firefox browser and login (or open any other site that uses https (e.g. google.com)).

Right-click the lock and click Certificate to view certificate issuer details.

Open the Certification Path tab.

Choose the first certificate that appears at the top of the list and press the Show Certificate button.

Open the Details tab and click the Copy to File ... button.

Choose base64 encoded X.509 format (* .cer) and click Next button.

Click the Browse button and enter a location and file name. Remember to save with the extension "cer". Example: D: \Users\uendel\Desktop\proxy.cer

Close the windows and open the Windows command prompt and run the following command line (replace the location with the path where you saved the certificate):

SET NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=D:\Users\uendel\Desktop\heroku.cer

Revert to the old OpenSSL behaviour:

git config --global http.sslBackend "openssl"
git config --global http.sslCAInfo D:\Users\uendel\Desktop\heroku.cer
